# NotIMDB

## Description
This is a website specifically aimed at movie ratings. You can lookup any title you like and see how it compares to other movies according to critics. Next time your friends say this movie is better than that one... just look it up.

This project was to created to help people find there favorite movies and see where they stack up amongst all other movies and hopefully help people find other highly rated movies...or who knows maybe even some that are so bad they're good.
This site is direct and straight to the point. The movie, the rating according to critics, and where it stacks up to all other movies.
This was our first time working together and through trials and tribulation we learned the true meaning of team work in an agile enviroment with a deadline.
